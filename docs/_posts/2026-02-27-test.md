The Seam of Totality opens in the sky like a figment of heretical absolution, heralding the dawn of the era of the Nemesis. How wrong were we to estimate that boundless, impressive frame of such, the totality structure. Thinking we were about to complete it all, our path towards the infinite, when in reality, the Axioms, as fragile as glass, break apart to reveal their rigid core and project themselves into the distance beyond you. The Fifth Wall looms ahead, the infinitesimal of a construct so large, so illogical, preventing you from passing into what lies beyond. As you approach the wall, the cacophony climbs to an insurmountable magnitude, as we were only given moments of bliss before we realised the enormous monolith was a blade of grass in comparison to the next one, every concept you brought with you crumbling in your hands as you lose your mind comprehending the scale that comes before us.

The above synthesises:
* The Seam of Totality's description (by Istamtae)
* The Poem of the Fortieth Class (also by Istamtae)
